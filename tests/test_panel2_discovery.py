"""Offline check that a panel Truma renumbers is still offered for setup.

No hardware, no Home Assistant install: the HA imports are stubbed so the real
``bt`` helpers and the real ``config_flow`` steps run.

Why this exists: an iNet X Panel 2 was heard by its owner's proxy, reachable,
and never offered -- no discovery card, nothing in the UI to say why, which
from outside is indistinguishable from the integration not hearing it at all
(issue #6). Two separate gates did that. The config flow threw away any advert
whose name did not start with ``Truma iNetX``, even when a Truma service UUID
had routed it there; and the matching itself listed the two service UUIDs the
original panel puts on air, while a Panel 2 advertises a third, fc310006.

Both are now settled by an nRF Connect capture of a Panel 2 (hardware 1.4,
firmware 3.5.38.1). It advertises one service, fc310006, manufacturer data
under Truma's company ID 0x0c73 -- and the name ``Truma iNetX-5770EB``, which
does still carry the prefix. So the renamed-panel case is hypothetical rather
than live; it is kept below because nothing guarantees the next generation
keeps the prefix, and the first word of the UUID has already moved once. What
does not move is the UUID base, ``-f3b2-11e8-8eb2-f2801f1b9fd1``, so that is
what matching keys on.

Identification cannot simply drop the name test either, because Home Assistant
substitutes the (rotating) address when an advert carries no local name, which
is what passive scanning and the original panel's add-device mode both give.
Keying on that would spawn a new MAC-titled discovery card every RPA rotation.
So identification and keying are split: a Truma UUID *or* the known prefix
identifies a panel, and only a real name keys it.

What it pins:

1. the advert a real Panel 2 sends is identified and keyed by its own name,
2. any UUID in Truma's space identifies a panel, including numbers nobody has
   seen yet -- no release needed for the next renumbering,
3. a renamed panel carrying a Truma UUID is identified and keyed by the name it
   does advertise,
4. an advert whose "name" is really just the address never keys anything, in
   either flow step,
5. the original panel still works by name alone, with no service UUID in the
   advert (passive scanning shows no scan response),
6. an unrelated BLE device is not picked up by the manual step.
