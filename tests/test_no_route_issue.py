"""Offline check for the "nothing can connect to the panel" repair issue.

No hardware, no Home Assistant install: the HA/bleak imports are stubbed so the
real ``bt.async_panel_advertising`` and the real coordinator methods run.

Why this exists: the condition was already computed and thrown away (a debug
log line in ``bt.py``), so a user whose setup cannot reach the panel saw
entities sit unavailable with no explanation. The risk in surfacing it is
crying wolf -- warning on a transient miss, or blaming someone's Bluetooth
setup when their panel is simply switched off.

What it pins:

1. the panel is recognised by service UUID as well as by local name (pairing
   adverts carry no name),
2. a run of failures shorter than the threshold stays silent,
3. the issue is raised exactly at the threshold and NOT re-raised afterwards,
4. a panel we cannot hear at all never raises it, and does not even count
   towards the threshold -- that is a different fault with different advice,
5. a successful resolve clears both the counter and the issue.

Run: ``python3 tests/test_no_route_issue.py``
