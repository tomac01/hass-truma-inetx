"""Offline check that a panel which refuses every unbonded link still pairs.

No hardware, no Home Assistant install: the HA/bleak/dbus imports are stubbed
so the real ``pairing.ensure_bonded`` loop and the real
``pairing._ensure_bonded_bluez`` loop run against fakes.

Why this exists (issue #26, a Raspi 3B with a USB dongle and no proxy,
2026-09-17): the panel was heard on its identity address and nothing else, and
every connect died the same way 750 ms in --

    Failed to connect after 1 attempt(s): failed to discover services,
    device disconnected

-- twenty-six times in sixty seconds. ``ensure_bonded`` dispatches on the
client it gets, so a connect that never returns one never reaches the dispatch:
``Device1.Pair()`` was never called, the Just Works agent was never registered,
and the one procedure that could have bonded the panel sat behind the connect
that bonding was supposed to make possible.

What it pins:

1. a connect that has failed on every advertised address hands over to the
   BlueZ path instead of re-dialling,
2. every address gets its turn first, so the RPA rotation that cures a stale
   proxy bond is not cut short,
3. a *bond* failure is still the rotation's business and does not trigger it,
4. the hand-over needs a BlueZ object path to pair on, and without one nothing
   is claimed,
5. the bond is dropped only after the panel has refused it -- try, then
   remove,
6. and only when the caller could not establish a link at all, so Reconfigure
   on a working bond is reported rather than destroyed, whether the fast path
   or the loop is what reads it,
7. one removal attempt per call, so a RemoveDevice BlueZ refuses cannot eat
   the timeout,
8. a bond this host holds alone is never reported as success,
9. and the link ``Pair()`` opened is dropped before the bond is reported --
   BlueZ keeps it, and the kernel then refuses the session's every connect.
