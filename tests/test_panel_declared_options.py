"""Offline checks for offering what the device says this vehicle has.

No hardware, no Home Assistant install: HA is stubbed and the real ``bus.py``,
``profiles.py``, ``climate.py`` and ``select.py`` are loaded against it, and
the entities are built by the platforms' own setup.

Why this exists. A list of modes written into the source is wrong in both
directions at once. Measured on two vehicles:

- this van's panel enumerates ``RoomClimate.Mode`` as
  ``{0: Off, 3: Heating, 5: Ventilating}`` -- it has no air conditioner, and 1
  and 2 are absent from the enum rather than present-and-unavailable,
- the Combi 6 E in #11 reports 1 = automatic and 2 = cooling on the same
  parameter, verified at the panel.

Offering a fixed ``[0, 3, 5]`` locks that vehicle out of its own air
conditioner; offering everything puts cooling on a van that cannot cool. So the
device is asked. The same goes for the water-heating steps (#12).

And it is asked *per device*, which is the other half. A description is the
property of whichever device gave it: a Combi's fan and a roof air
conditioner's need not run to the same maximum, so a control built from a
merged description offers values its own hardware refuses.

What it pins:

1. the values the owning device enumerates are what gets offered, and one that
   describes nothing still gets the list this integration always had,
2. a value marked unavailable for this vehicle is not offered,
3. the panel's *names* never reach a user-facing string -- they arrive in the
   panel's display language (``40 / 60 / 70`` here, Eco / Comfort / Hot on the
   Combi 6 E), so only the values cross over,
4. a write is validated against that device's enum where there is one, so a
   mode this heater really has stops being rejected by our own table,
5. off is always offered on the climate entity, whatever the panel says,
6. each select is created only on a device that reports its parameter -- a
   Combi D has no electric element and its panel never mentions the parameter,
7. a slider's range comes from its own device, not from a constant that happens
   to be a Combi's,
8. an off a device enumerates itself writes that value, and an off this
   integration invents writes the parameter that switches the function off
   (#28),
9. and every option a select offers can be selected, which is the general form
   of #28: the two go into one flat list of strings and come back as one.
