"""Offline checks for the energy sources, the batteries and the heat the Combi makes.

No hardware and no Home Assistant install: HA is stubbed and the real
``bus.py``, ``profiles.py``, ``sensor.py``, ``switch.py`` and
``binary_sensor.py`` are loaded against it, then the entities are constructed
and read.

Why this exists:

- **#16.** ``EnergySrc.GasLevel`` was not mapped at all, so a gas/electric
  Combi had no gas reading. It is writable, and a write does go through -- but
  the heater writes it too: measured on that vehicle, switching the electric
  element off moved the gas source on by itself. A switch would fight the
  heater and flap, so gas is reflected and never commanded.
- The same issue exposes the mirror-image bug: the diesel switch was created on
  every vehicle, including gas Combis with no diesel burner and no
  ``EnergySrc.DieselLevel`` at all.
- **#17.** The starter and leisure battery voltages ride on the electrical
  block, in tenths of a volt -- a different scale from ``Eol.Vcc12``, which is
  millivolts.
- **#15 and #24.** ``System.FlameStatus`` takes 0, 1 and 2, and nothing the
  panel publishes says what they mean. Two vehicles have now measured the same
  three: a Combi 6 E against a shore-power meter, where 2 is the appliance
  standing by rather than a second kind of firing, and a Combi 4 gas watched at
  the panel. So the sensor names them instead of showing a code.
- **#27.** And they are not named after a flame. On that same Combi 6 E, with
  the gas switched off at the appliance and the 1800 W element carrying the
  load, the parameter read 1 for seven minutes with nothing burning, and went
  1 -> 2 as the element stopped. Truma's name for the parameter is
  ``FlameStatus``; the entities built from it are Heating and Heating status.

What it pins:

1. gas, diesel and both batteries reach the entities built on them, on the
   device that published them,
2. gas is a read-only reflection -- its row is a binary sensor, and no
   platform writes ``EnergySrc.GasLevel``,
3. each of them is created when, and only when, its parameter is reported,
4. the batteries are scaled by ten, not by a thousand,
5. the heating status is named -- off, running, idle -- and keeps the number
   it was named from, and a value nobody has named reads unknown rather than
   being folded into a state it does not belong in,
6. the heating flag is on while the appliance makes heat and off while it
   merely stands by,
7. and no entity is identified by what it is called: a row's translation_key
   is absent from every unique_id, which is what makes a wrong name cheap to
   correct.
