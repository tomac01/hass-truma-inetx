"""Offline check for the RPA rotation in ``ensure_bonded``.

No hardware, no Home Assistant install: the HA/bleak/dbus imports are stubbed
so the pairing loop can be driven against fake clients.

This is the mechanism that makes a re-pair work on a **stock** ESPHome
Bluetooth proxy, with no bond-clearing button and no custom firmware. Measured
on the van twice on 2026-07-26: the panel rejects the bond on the address the
proxy still holds a stale bond for (``Pairing failed due to error: 97``) and
tears the link down immediately, then advertises a fresh RPA the proxy has no
bond for, which pairs cleanly. Total ~9s.

What it pins:

1. an address that fails to bond is demoted, and the next pass gets the
   panel's other RPA,
2. bonding succeeds on that second address,
3. when the demoted address is the only one advertised it is retried rather
   than the loop stalling forever (a rejected address heals after a panel
   power-cycle),
4. an address that bonds first try is never demoted.

Run: ``python3 scripts/test_pairing_rotation.py``
