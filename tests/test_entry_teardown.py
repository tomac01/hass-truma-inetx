"""Offline check that unloading the entry leaves nothing of ours running.

No hardware, no Home Assistant install: the HA and bleak imports are stubbed
so the real ``async_stop`` and the real ``async_unload_entry``/
``async_setup_entry`` run.

Why this exists: reloading the config entry used to leave the integration
unloaded with the BLE client still connected -- measured on the van,
2026-09-15, and reachable by enabling or disabling a single entity, because
Home Assistant reloads the entry on that by itself. An orphaned link holds one
of the panel's ~4 connection slots, so the entry could not be reloaded by hand
either; only restarting Home Assistant cleared it.

What it pins:

1. the session task is ended *before* the link is closed -- a task cancelled
   mid-flight cannot run its own teardown, so anything it held would be left
   connected,
2. a session that will not end is cancelled, and the stop still returns rather
   than hanging the unload that is waiting on it,
3. a handed-off pairing link that no session ever adopted is closed too, and
   a session cancelled by something else does not stop the rest of the
   teardown -- while a cancellation aimed at the stop itself is not swallowed,
4. the session is stopped even when a platform refuses to unload, and the
   refusal is still reported,
5. a setup that fails after the session was launched stops it on the way out,
   since Home Assistant never calls unload for an entry whose setup raised.

Run: ``python3 tests/test_entry_teardown.py``
