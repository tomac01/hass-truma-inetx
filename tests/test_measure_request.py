"""Offline checks for asking the tank sensors to measure.

No hardware, no Home Assistant install: the HA/bleak imports are stubbed so the
real ``coordinator._request_measurements`` and the real hold loop in
``coordinator._finish_startup`` run, and the frames they emit are parsed back
with the real ``truma.protocol``.

Why this exists (reported on a Weinsberg, issue #4): a tank sensor answers with
the level it measured when it was last asked, and nothing on the bus asks it
except the panel, when its water screen is opened. So a grey tank emptied by
hand kept reporting 25 % indefinitely -- parameter discovery included, because
25 % is honestly the last measurement taken. The sensor was never wrong; the
question was hours old.

What it pins:

1. a measurement is asked for, as a write of 1 to ``<topic>.MeasureRequest``,
2. it is asked *repeatedly* while the link is held -- one reading per session
   is the bug, not the fix,
3. it is addressed to whoever reported the topic, never to an address named in
   the source: the tanks hang off an electrical block that is 0x0405 on the
   reporter's vehicle and something else on the next one,
4. a vehicle that has never reported a tank is never asked, because every
   vehicle subscribes to these topics whether or not it has the hardware,
5. and the reply lands in the state field the sensor reads, so an emptied tank
   actually moves.

Run: ``python3 tests/test_measure_request.py`` (needs ``cbor2``).
