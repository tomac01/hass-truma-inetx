"""Offline checks for the panel's six timer slots.

Measured on the van (2026-09-16), with one timer configured in the first slot
and nothing in the other five::

    TimerConfig.Timer1      {"id": 1, "name": "23 °C", "symbol": 1,
                             "start": "06:30", "end": "",
                             "wd": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}   type 206 perm 0
    TimerConfig.Timer1State 1                               type 119 avail 1
    TimerConfig.Timer2..6   the same shape, all zeros,      type 206 avail 0
    TimerConfig.TimerEnableCount 1                          min 0 max 255

What it pins:

1. a panel publishes all six slots always, and only the filled ones become
   entities -- an empty slot is not a timer that is off, it is not a timer,
2. a slot filled after startup gets its entities at that update, without a
   restart,
3. the switch arms and disarms its own slot,
4. the schedule reads the start time and carries the rest beside it, in the
   same shape whether or not the panel filled every field,
5. each pair is named by its slot number,
6. every key used here is named and iconed.
