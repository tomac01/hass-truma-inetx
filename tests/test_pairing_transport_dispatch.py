"""Offline check that bonding dispatches to the transport it actually has.

No hardware, no Home Assistant install: the HA/bleak/dbus imports are stubbed so
the real ``bt.async_resolve_device`` and the real
``pairing.ensure_bonded`` dispatch run.

Why this exists (observed on the van, 2026-08-23): with the USB dongle disabled
and only the Pi's built-in adapter enabled, pairing failed every time with

    proxy pair(): [org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationFailed] Authentication Failed

and bluetoothd said ``No agent available for request type 2``. Pairing chose
its procedure by asking which kind of scanner could *hear* the panel, and the
resolver of the day fell back to a local adapter, so the proxy branch won on
every ESP-less host. That branch registers no BlueZ pairing agent -- only
``_ensure_bonded_bluez`` does -- so Just Works confirmation could never be
answered.

The fix went further than adding a filter: which scanner heard an advert never
predicted the transport, because Home Assistant scores the connection paths
itself at every connect. ``ensure_bonded`` now connects first and dispatches on
the client it actually got.

What it pins:

1. the bonding path follows the connected client, not the scanner that heard
   the panel -- both ways round,
2. the bleak link is dropped before BlueZ is asked to pair on the same panel,
3. ``local_only`` -- the one transport filter left -- answers only with a local
   adapter's device, because only that carries a BlueZ object path.

Then the failure that fix uncovered: with the local path finally reached, pairing
reported success in 18 ms and the panel never saw it. The bond search was
unscoped, so it matched the USB dongle's surviving bond -- HA's entry for that
adapter was disabled, but the adapter was still powered and still bonded. So:

5. an existing bond is not trusted when the pairing adapter is unknown,
6. it is trusted when found on the adapter being paired,
7. and scoping to an adapter without the bond finds nothing.
