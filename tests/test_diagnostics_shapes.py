"""Offline checks for reading a diagnostics download back into a bus.

``bus.py`` needs no stubbing and no Home Assistant, which is why this is its
own file: ``tests/test_bus_dump_tool.py`` loads the integration's diagnostics
module and so needs the protocol stack behind it, and the reader tested here
is the half a person runs on somebody else's file.

Why it exists: ``from_diagnostics`` read one shape -- the value the
integration returns -- and a downloaded file is that value wrapped in
``data`` by Home Assistant. So ``tools/dump_bus.py somebody-else.json``
rebuilt an empty bus and printed nothing at all, for every real download,
including the three attached to issues. Nothing said it had failed.

What it pins:

1. a real 0.9 download, wrapper and all, reads back device by device,
2. a pre-0.9 download reads back too: its per-device store is where the
   devices come from, and addresses that answered but published nothing
   attributable are still on the bus,
3. a pre-0.7 download, which has only a flat store, lands in `unattributed`
   rather than under a device that would be a guess,
4. the integration's own return value keeps working, wrapper or not,
5. every real download stored in ``dumps/`` still reads back, and none of
   them carries a BLE address.

Run: ``python3 tests/test_diagnostics_shapes.py``
