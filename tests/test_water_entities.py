"""Offline checks for the water entities and how their writes are addressed.

``bus.py`` needs no stubbing at all -- that is the point of keeping it free of
Home Assistant. The platforms are loaded for real against a stub coordinator,
because "create it on the device that reports it" is the part with actual
logic in it.

Why this exists: the fresh-water pump and the tank levels belong to a device
that is not the heater and not the panel -- an electrical block, at 0x0405 on
the two vehicles reported so far (issues #4, #7 and #8). Its address differs
per vehicle and is renumbered when it is re-paired, so a write cannot be sent
to an address named in the source. And most vehicles have no water hardware at
all, so the entities cannot simply be created for everyone.

What it pins:

1. the water parameters land under the device that published them, and the
   entities built on them read that device rather than the bus,
2. an entity is created when -- and only when -- its parameter is reported,
   on the device that reported it, and only once,
3. a write goes to that same device, and no address for the water hardware is
   written into the source,
4. a topic the panel relays keeps going to the panel,
5. the pump only accepts 0 and 1,
6. every translation key the presentation table and the platforms use has a
   name in strings.json, the water sensors carry an icon (having no device
   class to draw one from), and every non-English translation still covers
   every key English has.
