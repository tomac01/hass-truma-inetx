"""Offline checks for what the panel offers beyond its controls.

Taken from the van's own parameter dump (2026-09-16), every device the panel
had let us hear from, read with the panel's own metadata beside each value::

    TimeAndDate.SystemTime   1789574460  [t18 min0 max4294967295]
    Eol.Vcc5                 5058        [t11 min0 max65535]
    Panel.UserInactiveSince  2850        [t18 min0 max4294967295]
    PowerMgmt.PwrMode        3           [t102]
    Temperature.InternalSource 1         [t1 perm0 min0 max255]
    RoomClimate.Active       4           [t107]
    System.DemoMode          0           [t2 enum Off/On/On and configured]
    EnergySrc.NeedsEnergySrc 1           [t104 perm0]   (on the heater)
    ErrorReset.ResetTime     60          [t18 perm0 min0 max60]

What it pins:

1. the panel's clock is read as a UTC epoch and presented as a time, which is
   what the timers fire off,
2. a field whose range is the width of the field rather than a range reads
   unknown at either end instead of graphing 1970,
3. the readings that belong to the panel land on the panel and the ones that
   belong to the appliance land on the appliance,
4. everything here is diagnostic, and the ones that either move constantly or
   mean nothing measured yet are off until somebody asks for them,
5. every key is named and iconed.
