"""Offline checks that an entity waits for its device to be named.

No hardware, no Home Assistant install: HA is stubbed and the real
``entity.py``, ``sensor.py`` and ``climate.py`` are loaded against it, so the
platforms' own setup decides what gets built and when.

Why this exists (#23, measured on a Combi 6 E + iNet X Pro with a roof air
conditioner, an electrical block and two gas-bottle sensors). Home Assistant
builds an entity id out of its device's name at the moment the entity is
created, and never revises it. A bus device is registered as ``Bus device
0xNNNN`` until ``Identify.Name`` arrives -- and the name arrives *late*,
because subscribing makes the panel push values while the descriptions that
carry the name are not asked for until later in startup. So nine of about
seventy entities came up like this and stayed:

    climate.bus_device_0x0201
    sensor.bus_device_0x0405_storungscode
    number.bus_device_0x0406_lufterstufe

while their siblings on the same devices came up ``combi_6_e_*``,
``ebl25x_5_*`` and ``freshjet_6_*``. A race, not a rule, and the owner's only
fix was renaming nine entities by hand.

What it pins:

1. a value alone does not build an entity -- the device's name is what is
   waited for, and the wait is not recorded as done,
2. the entity is built at the update that settles the name, on both creation
   paths (the table's, and the per-device one the climate entity uses),
3. nothing waits forever: when discovery finishes, a device that has named
   itself nothing gets its entities under the address it is at,
4. the owner's own label settles it too, for a device that publishes no
   Identify at all.
