"""Offline check that a diagnostics download still reads back into a dump.

``tools/dump_bus.py`` is the only way to look at somebody's bus without Home
Assistant, and it earns that by not importing Home Assistant at all: it puts
``truma_inetx`` on ``sys.modules`` by hand, pointing at the source directory,
and loads ``bus`` out of it without ever running the package ``__init__`` --
which is the integration's Home Assistant entry point and would fail on its
first line.

Neither end of that is covered by the tests next door. They exercise ``bus``
by importing it the same way themselves, so the launcher could stop working --
a moved file, a renamed module, a package ``__init__`` that grows an import --
and nothing would say so until somebody with a broken vehicle was asked for a
dump and could not produce one. And the download's own shape is a contract
between two files that never meet: ``diagnostics.py`` writes it inside Home
Assistant, ``bus.from_diagnostics`` reads it outside.

So the download here is written by the real ``diagnostics.py`` rather than by
hand -- a hand-written one drifts, and silently, because the reader fills in
what it does not find -- and the real script then reads it in its own process,
the way a person would.

What it pins:

1. what diagnostics.py writes is what from_diagnostics reads: devices with
   their names, serials and parameter descriptions, not a flat list,
2. the launcher loads and exits cleanly on it,
3. and a structured value survives the round trip, printed as it arrived,
   because a dump is for seeing what the panel really sent.

Run: ``python3 tests/test_bus_dump_tool.py``
