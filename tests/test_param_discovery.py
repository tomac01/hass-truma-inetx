"""Offline checks for the startup sequence: registration, then discovery.

No hardware, no Home Assistant install: the HA imports are stubbed so the
real ``session.run_startup``, ``session.discover_params`` and
``coordinator._on_frame`` run, and the frames they emit are parsed back with
the real ``truma.protocol``.

Why this exists (reported on a Combi 6 E + iNet X Pro, issue #7): startup asked
only the heater and the panel for their current values. Every other device on
the bus -- the electrical block, a roof air conditioner, two gas-bottle level
sensors -- publishes only when its value *changes*, so after a restart it said
nothing and its parameters stayed empty, while the panel's own screen showed
gas at 51 %, fresh water at 25 % and grey water at 0 %. Addressing each device
directly filled them in: the electrical block alone went from 4 to 31
parameters, including ``FreshWater.Level`` and ``GreyWater.Level``.

What it pins:

1. every seeded device is asked, not just the heater and the panel, and the
   frames are well-formed parameter-discovery requests from our own address,
2. a device that speaks but is in no seed is asked anyway -- addresses are
   renumbered on re-pairing, so the seed can never be authoritative,
3. no address is asked twice, or a bus that answers doubles every startup,
4. neither pseudo-address is treated as a device, and neither are we -- the
   single broadcast that is sent is an opener, and it pays for itself by
   feeding the directed round,
5. discovery is reached from ``_run_startup``, and asking a dozen devices does
   not cost a dozen multi-second waits,
6. a link that connects but never answers registration is dropped at once
   rather than carrying on into a startup that cannot work,
7. a discovery that not one address acknowledges is dropped too -- the same
   failure one step later, and the one the registration gate cannot see,
8. and a startup that hangs somewhere none of those gates can see is dropped
   on a deadline of its own, because the stall watchdog does not start until
   startup has finished.

Run: ``python3 tests/test_param_discovery.py`` (needs ``cbor2``).
