"""Offline checks for the panel's own Bluetooth side, at bus address 0x0601.

No hardware and no Home Assistant install: HA is stubbed and the real
``bus.py``, ``profiles.py`` and ``sensor.py`` are loaded against it, then the
entities are constructed and read.

Why this exists: a session can wedge with the link up by everything the host
reports and nothing carried over it, and the panel that could say why has
stopped answering by then -- so it cannot be asked during one. 0x0601
publishes the panel's own view of that link, and measured on the van it is the
only address on the bus that publishes no appliance parameter at all: seven
``BleDeviceManagement`` parameters, three ``DeviceManagement`` ones, and no
``Identify.Name``.

What it pins:

1. the three sensors are created on the device that published them, and only
   once it has,
2. the free-slot count is a measurement and the two state codes are not --
   they are codes, and a long-term average of a code is a number no device
   ever reported,
3. all three are diagnostics and all three are on by default -- a reading
   only worth having before the failure it explains cannot wait for somebody
   to go and enable it,
4. none of them is offered as a named state, because the panel describes none
   of them with an enum,
5. the free-slot count is summed out of the breakdown by device kind the
   parameter actually carries,
6. and a structured value a row does not reduce reads unknown rather than
   raising inside Home Assistant once per coordinator update.

Run: ``python3 tests/test_ble_mgmt_entities.py``
