"""BLE transport for Truma iNet X over Home Assistant's Bluetooth stack.

This is the bleak/HA-bluetooth port of the project's original dbus-fast
transport. The framing/CBOR protocol (``truma/protocol.py``) is reused
unchanged; only the connection + GATT I/O layer differs.

Transport FSM (per ``send``):
  1. Write ``[0x01, len_lo, len_hi]`` (InitDataTransfer) to CMD (with response).
  2. Wait for a Ready notification (0x81) on CMD.
  3. Write the packet to DATA_W (without response).
  4. Wait for a DataAck notification (0xF0) on CMD.

An incoming-message announcement (0x83 + uint16 length) is answered with
0x0300. DATA_R fragments are accumulated to that length, acknowledged once
with 0xF001, and then parsed into a complete V3 frame.

# BlueZ's Connected but leaves the kernel link, which bt-ghostbuster only takes
# down at its 2-minute mark; BlueZ reconnects a second or two later. Dialling
