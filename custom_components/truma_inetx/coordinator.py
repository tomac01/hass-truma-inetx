# connection slots are contended: a held link occupies one permanently, and on a
# single dongle shared with other devices that can starve them out entirely
# (van 2026-08-20: the DC-DC charger lost its slot and went unavailable).
#
# Seconds, not minutes: a minute is already coarse next to a poll that takes
