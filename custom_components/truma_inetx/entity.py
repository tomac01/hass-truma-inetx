    Vehicles differ, and so do buses. A Combi and a panel are always there,
    but fresh and grey water tanks, a pump, gas-bottle sensors, an electrical
    block and a roof air conditioner are each present on some installations
    and absent on most. Creating their entities up front would give everyone
    else a row of permanently unknown values, and a value that is unknown
    because the hardware does not exist looks exactly like one that is unknown
    because the integration is broken.

    So the parameter arriving *is* the evidence the hardware exists -- and
    which device published it is the evidence of where it lives. Since startup
    asks every device on the bus for its values, that evidence lands within
    seconds of connecting rather than whenever the tank next happens to move.

    Entities are added once and never removed: hardware that has answered once
    but is quiet now is still hardware, and deleting the entity would take its
    history with it. A device that appears later simply gets its entities
    then, which is how a battery-powered gas sensor that takes minutes to wake
    up is handled without waiting for it at startup.

    A row that opts into ``requires_avail`` asks for one thing more: that the
    device stop saying the parameter is unavailable. That is for the fixed-size
    lists a device publishes whole -- a panel has six timer slots whether or
    not it has six timers, and publishes all six, marking the empty ones
    ``avail`` 0. Waiting for the flag is still waiting for evidence; it is just
    the evidence that this copy of the parameter means something.
