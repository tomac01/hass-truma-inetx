    Vehicles differ. A Combi and a panel are always there, but fresh and grey
    water tanks, a pump, gas-bottle sensors and a roof air conditioner are
    each present on some installations and absent on most. Creating their
    entities up front would give everyone else a row of permanently unknown
    values, and a value that is unknown because the hardware does not exist
    looks exactly like one that is unknown because the integration is broken.

    So the parameter arriving *is* the evidence the hardware exists. Since
    startup now asks every device on the bus for its values, that evidence
    lands within seconds of connecting rather than whenever the tank next
    happens to move.

    ``pending`` maps a ``Topic.Param`` key to a factory for the entity it
    justifies. Entities are added once and never removed: hardware that has
    answered once but is quiet now is still hardware, and deleting the entity
    would take its history with it.
