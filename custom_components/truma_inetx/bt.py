"""Shared Bluetooth resolution for the Truma iNet X panel.

The panel uses a rotating Resolvable Private Address, so a stored MAC goes
stale. Both the live session (coordinator) and the onboarding bond (config
flow) have to find the panel the same way, and this module is the single
source of that resolution.

What it resolves is an **address**, not a route. Which adapter carries the
connection is Home Assistant's decision: habluetooth swaps
``bleak_retry_connector.BleakClientWithServiceCache`` for its own wrapper, and
that wrapper throws away the scanner the BLEDevice came from, keeps only the
address, and re-picks the best connectable path at connect time -- scoring
every candidate by RSSI, by how many connects to *that address* have already
failed on that scanner, by connects in flight, and by free connection slots.
Nothing in HA pins a device to a scanner, so a transport preference expressed
here is overruled a moment later anyway. This module used to hold one; it only
made the wrong address get tried first (issue #13).

Nothing here asks which transport it got, either. The one caller that needs
to know -- ``pairing``, where bonding *is* the transport -- reads it off the
connected client instead (``ble.client_is_proxy``). ``local_only`` below is
the single remaining exception, and it is a data requirement rather than a
preference.

    A name reaches Home Assistant only in a scan response, and only an active

    four minutes after the scanner starts, then once every twelve hours

    fifteen seconds a window). There are per-device windows too, but only for
    an address some integration registered a Bluetooth callback on, and this
    one registers none -- it reads the advertisement history instead.

    Outside those windows nothing solicits a scan response, so nothing sends
    one. Measured on the van (2026-09-18): forty-five seconds of passive
    scanning, 468 advertising reports, not one Name field from any device on
    the bus. The panel's advertisement proper is twenty-one bytes -- flags, and
    one Truma service UUID -- which is enough to *recognise* a panel and not
    enough to *key* one. So discovery aborted "awaiting_name" on every advert
    and the manual step reported "no devices found", on a panel sitting there
    advertising, with no way to tell that from not hearing it at all.

    It only looks like it works on a host that has bonded the panel before:
    BlueZ keeps the name in ``/var/lib/bluetooth/<adapter>/<addr>/info`` and
    hands it over whatever the scan mode. Drop the bond and the name goes with
    it, which is exactly the state a first pairing is in.

    ``cooldown``: skip if a sweep was asked for that recently. A sweep is
    bus-wide and concurrent callers dedupe into one window, so the cost of
    asking is small -- but not small enough to ask several times a second.

    ``until``: checked after each window; stop as soon as it is true. Without
    one, keep asking until ``SWEEP_DEADLINE``, since a request the scheduler
    refused returns success-shaped and there is nothing else to tell us.

    ACTIVE and PASSIVE scanners ignore the request, so this changes nothing on

    connectable can reach it (the caller should retry).

    Which **adapter** ends up carrying that connection is not decided here and
    cannot be -- Home Assistant re-picks the path at connect time; see the
    module docstring. So the device handed back is really an address with a
    scanner attached, and the ranking below is entirely about addresses.

    Fresh beats stale, and the identity address is ranked below the RPAs by
    default: through a proxy it usually dials a stale cached bonded RPA rather
    than the live one. It is still worth a try once the RPAs are exhausted,
    because it is the panel's real on-air address in add-device mode -- and on
    a host whose kernel puts the peer's identity on air, it is the *only*
    address that ever connects. ``prefer_identity`` flips that one comparison
    for a host that has proved this, which is what issue #13 costs otherwise:
    every session walking the RPAs, timing out on each, before reaching the
    address that works. It reorders, it never excludes -- a wrong memory costs
    one attempt, not the connection.

    ``avoid`` is a set of addresses that failed to establish. This exists
    because of a specific, observed failure mode after pairing:

    Right after the bond, the panel keeps *advertising* the RPA it paired on
    but stops *accepting connections* on it (a panel-side phantom from the
    pairing hand-off), while it simultaneously advertises a fresh, live RPA.
    Both addresses look equally valid here — same name, near-identical
    timestamps — but connecting the dead one fails forever with
    ESP_GATT_CONN_FAIL_ESTABLISH (0x3e). Without ``avoid`` we always return the
    same first candidate and the coordinator hammers the dead address
    indefinitely, leaving the device "unavailable" until someone power-cycles
    the panel. The coordinator feeds back each address that failed to establish
    so we rotate to the panel's other advertised RPA instead.

    ``avoid`` **demotes**, it does not exclude. A failed address ranks below
    every address that has not failed, which is enough to rotate off a phantom
    while a live RPA is on air — but when the failed address is the only route
    left we hand it back and let the caller retry, because the set cannot tell
    a phantom from a transient failure. Excluding was a bug (#14): it erased
    the identity address, which never rotates and so can never be the phantom,
    so one failure against it — the panel still holding the slot of a
    just-closed session, say — banished the only route a host connecting over
    the identity has.

    ``local_only`` restricts the answer to what a local adapter can see. It is
    not a preference and not a speed choice, and it has exactly one legitimate
    caller: ``pairing._bluez_path()`` needs the BlueZ object path to call
    ``Device1.Pair()`` on, and only a local adapter's device carries one. There
    is deliberately no mirror of it -- wanting a proxy is what this module used
