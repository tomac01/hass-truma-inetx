    Matches the panel by its stable advertised ``name`` OR primary service UUID
    (the local name is absent from add-device/pairing adverts), picks the
    freshest advertised RPA, and prefers a device reachable through a remote
    (proxy) scanner: a proxy's controller resolves private addresses itself, so
    it reconnects on any host, and using it also keeps a local adapter from
    stealing the connection. A local adapter is returned only when no proxy can
    hear the panel — on a stock host that link will pair but never reconnect,
    which is what the ``no_proxy_route`` repair issue is about. Returns ``None``
    when nothing can reach it right now (the caller should retry).

    Because of that local fallback, a non-``None`` result does **not** mean a
    proxy can reach the panel. Pass ``remote_only=True`` to ask that narrower
    question -- callers that must know which transport they got, rather than
    just wanting the best route, have to. ``pairing.ensure_bonded()`` does: the
    proxy and local BlueZ bonding paths are not interchangeable, because only
    the local one registers a BlueZ pairing agent.

    The "resolved identity" pseudo-address (whose last bytes match the name
    suffix, e.g. ``...FFB4D1``) is ranked below the RPAs — via a proxy it
    usually dials a stale cached bonded RPA rather than the live one, but it is
    the panel's real on-air address while in add-device mode, so it is worth a
    try once the RPAs are exhausted.

    ``avoid`` is a set of addresses that failed to establish. This exists
    because of a specific, observed failure mode after pairing:

    Right after the bond, the panel keeps *advertising* the RPA it paired on
    but stops *accepting connections* on it (a panel-side phantom from the
    pairing hand-off), while it simultaneously advertises a fresh, live RPA.
    Both addresses look equally valid here — same name, both connectable via the
    proxy, near-identical timestamps — but connecting the dead one fails
    forever with ESP_GATT_CONN_FAIL_ESTABLISH (0x3e). Without ``avoid`` we
    always return the same first candidate and the coordinator hammers the dead
    address indefinitely, leaving the device "unavailable" until someone
    power-cycles the panel. The coordinator feeds back each address that failed
    to establish so we rotate to the panel's other advertised RPA instead.

    ``avoid`` **demotes**, it does not exclude. A failed address ranks below
    every address that has not failed, which is enough to rotate off a phantom
    while a live RPA is on air — but when the failed address is the only route
    left we hand it back and let the caller retry, because the set cannot tell
    a phantom from a transient failure. Excluding was a bug (#14): it erased
    the identity address, which never rotates and so can never be the phantom,
    so one failure against it — the panel still holding the slot of a
    just-closed session, say — banished the only route a host connecting over
    the identity has.
