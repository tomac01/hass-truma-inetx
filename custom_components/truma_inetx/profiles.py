"""What a bus parameter looks like in Home Assistant.

One table, keyed by the parameter's own name on the wire::

    (topic, parameter) -> the rows it is presented as

A row is presentation and nothing else: which platform, which device class,
which unit, how to scale the wire value, which translation key names it. The
*device* it belongs to is not in here, because that is a property of the bus,
not of the parameter -- a Combi and a roof air conditioner both publish
``AirCirculation.FanLevel`` and each gets its own fan from this one row.

Three things follow from the table being a table:

* **Unmapped parameters are skipped.** Serial numbers, vendor blobs and the
  hundred-odd housekeeping parameters a panel publishes need no special case;
  they simply have no row.
* **New hardware is new rows.** It used to cost a typed state field, an entry
  in a topic map, a ``value_fn`` lambda and a row in an optional-sensor tuple,
  in four files.
* **The panel's own description refines a row, it never creates one.** 33
  topics with many parameters each would generate hundreds of nameless
  entities, and the panel's enum names arrive in its display language and
  differ per vehicle (#12), so they cannot be option strings either. What the
  description *is* good for is bounds, which values exist, and whether a
  parameter may be written at all -- see ``Device.bounds`` /
  ``allowed_values`` / ``writable``.

Qualifiers decorate a row rather than multiplying it. Two gas bottles are two
devices publishing one row, told apart by the device they hang off -- see
``TrumaCoordinator.device_info``, which names a device by its class instance.
