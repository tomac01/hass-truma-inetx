"""The panel's bus, modelled the way the panel models it.

The Truma iNet X Panel is not a heater remote. It is a multi-homed gateway: a
TIN bus of Truma appliances, a CI bus of vehicle electrics and third-party air
conditioners, a CAN bus, and Bluetooth for gas sensors and for us. What it
publishes is therefore a *bus*, and every frame on it says which device spoke:

    (src address, topic, parameter) -> value, plus the panel's own description

A device address is ``class << 8 | instance``, and the instance is assigned at
pairing and renumbered when a device is re-paired. So no static map of the bus
can be right for every installation, and none is attempted here.

This module holds that model and nothing else. It imports no Home Assistant --
everything in it is testable, and dumpable, with no HA install: ``_main()``
below reads a diagnostics download or talks to a panel over Bluetooth, and
``tools/dump_bus.py --help`` is how it is run.

What this replaced, and why
---------------------------

Until this rewrite every value was flattened into one dict keyed
``Topic.Param``, and ~30 typed fields were assigned from a fixed
``(topic, param) -> field`` table. Both assert that a topic has exactly one
owner, which is simply not true of a bus: subscription names *topics* and is
addressed to the broker, so every device implementing a topic publishes under
it.

Issue #9 is what that looks like on a vehicle. Not a merely stale reading, but
a plausible wrong one assembled out of two devices::

    GasBtl.Name        "Rechts"     <- the right-hand bottle
    GasBtl.FillLevelP  49           <- the *left* one; the right is at 100

...and the same for a Combi's ``AirCirculation.FanLevel`` against a roof air
conditioner's, and for ``Identify``, which every device on the bus publishes,
so the panel's own name and serial ended up being whichever gas sensor spoke
last.

There is no flat view here to fall back to. It was right wherever exactly one
device reported a topic -- which is most of them, which is why it survived so
long -- and wrong in exactly the cases anybody would want a second device for.
