# reading the bus is stale. Reported on a Weinsberg (issue #4): a grey tank
# emptied by hand still read 25 % afterwards, and a parameter discovery
# returned that same 25 % because it is genuinely the last measurement taken.
#
# Asking is a write of 1 to the topic's MeasureRequest parameter; the device
# answers with a fresh Level a moment later, through the ordinary
# notification path.
