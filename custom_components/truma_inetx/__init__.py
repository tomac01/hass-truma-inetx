    A HACS repository belongs to exactly one category, so this integration

    means it ships and updates with the integration instead of needing a second
    repository to version and tag.

    The integration version is in the query string on purpose: the frontend
    service worker caches these assets for weeks and a browser hard-refresh
    does not bypass it, so without a changing URL an updated card would not
    reach anyone.

    add_extra_js_url puts the card in a race with the frontend bundle: both are
    plain import() calls side by side in index.html, and the bundle is what
    installs the scoped-custom-element-registry polyfill. A card served this way
    must therefore defer its customElements.define() until the frontend exists,
    or it registers in the registry Lovelace has stopped looking at. The card
    file does that and explains it at length -- do not drop that wrapper.
