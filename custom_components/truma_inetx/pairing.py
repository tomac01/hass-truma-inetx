"""Bonding (pairing) for the Truma iNet X panel.

The panel uses **Just Works** pairing (no passkey shown) and only bonds while a
client is *actively* attempting to pair AND the panel is in add-device mode. It
also silently rejects new bonds when its stored device list is full, so the user
must clear that list first if pairing fails repeatedly.

``ensure_bonded()`` hides that behind one call. It connects first and then
bonds the way the link it was given requires — the transport is Home
Assistant's choice, so asking the connected client beats guessing from what
can hear the panel:

* **Over a proxy link** (``_bond_over_link``) — ``pair()`` with bleak, then
  verify the bond by accessing a protected characteristic. Validated
  end-to-end against the real panel. Re-pairing needs no clean-up on the
  proxy and so works on stock proxy firmware — see the ``avoid`` rotation in
  ``ensure_bonded``.
* **Over a local adapter** (``_ensure_bonded_bluez``) — bleak cannot do this
  one: BlueZ needs an agent registered to answer the Just Works confirmation.
  A faithful port of ``scripts/ha_pair.py``: register a NoInputNoOutput
  auto-accept agent, then busy-loop ``Device1.Pair()`` until the device
  reports ``Paired``, and drop the link that pairing opened (see
  ``_release_link``, without which nothing can connect afterwards).
  Validated end-to-end on the van, 2026-09-18: bonded in 6 s.

Bonding where HA will *connect* is the whole point of the order: a bond that
lives on a path HA does not use fails every later connect at encryption, which
looks exactly like broken hardware.

That order has one hole, and it is the whole of #26: on a host with no proxy,
the connect it dispatches on is the thing bonding is *for*. An unbonded panel
drops the link before its services resolve, so ``establish_connection`` never
returns a client, the dispatch never runs, and ``Device1.Pair()`` is never
called -- twenty-six attempts, sixty seconds, the agent never registered
(measured on a Raspi 3B with a USB dongle, 2026-09-17). So a connect that has
failed on every address the panel is advertising falls back to the BlueZ path,
which needs no link of its own in order to bond. Only the fallback is new: a
connect that *succeeds* still decides the transport, because a link in hand is
the only thing that ever predicted it.

    to probe for a proxy and take the proxy path whenever one could hear the

    is nothing for the fallback to do, and the failure is somewhere else.

    Returns ``(bonded, client)``. Over a proxy link ``client`` is the LIVE,

    avoids the disconnect/reconnect that wedges the just-bonded RPA); the caller
    owns it and must disconnect it if it does not hand it off. Over local BlueZ

    """Bond the Truma panel over local BlueZ (D-Bus). Return ``True`` if bonded.

    Registers a temporary Just Works agent and busy-loops ``Device1.Pair()``
    until the panel reports ``Paired`` or ``timeout`` elapses. The caller must
    have prompted the user to put the panel into add-device mode (and to clear
    its device list if it is full).

    ``adapter_path`` (e.g. ``/org/bluez/hci0``) scopes the bond to the adapter
    HA connects through; when omitted, any adapter that sees the panel is used.

    ``trust_existing_bond`` is whether BlueZ reporting ``Paired`` may be taken
    as the answer. Normally it may: the caller got as far as a link before
    handing over, so a bond on this adapter is one the panel honours. It may
    not when the caller has never seen the panel answer one -- because nothing
    would establish a link (#26), or because it has not dialled yet -- and a
    bond is half-held by definition then. BlueZ will offer a key the panel has
    forgotten and the panel drops the link the moment it cannot decrypt, which
    is indistinguishable from a panel that was never paired, so a host-side
    ``Paired`` would report success against a panel that has seen nothing.

    ``Paired`` is not even evidence that a key exists. BlueZ reports it (and
    ``Bonded``) for a stored record carrying nothing but the signature keys,
    which is what the van's adapter held on 2026-09-18 after the panel's own
    bond was deleted: no ``LongTermKey``, no session possible, and a fast path
    that believed it answered in under a millisecond.

    Unproven, the order is try **then** remove: ``Device1.Pair()`` goes first
    and the bond is dropped only once that has failed with BlueZ still claiming
    ``Paired``. Removing up front would be the cheaper code and the worse
    behaviour -- re-pairing is the one path a user reaches with a *working*
    bond (Reconfigure), and a panel that is not in add-device mode at that
    moment would be left with no bond at all. One removal *attempt* per call,
    and only after the panel has refused: a removal that does not go through
    leaves the bond suspect, so the call runs out its timeout rather than
    reporting a success it cannot see -- and does not spend that timeout
    retrying a D-Bus call that has already said no.

    BlueZ transport only. Safe to call when already bonded (returns quickly).

    integration looked exactly like a panel that had paired and then vanished
    -- one device, one entity, disconnected.

    Not a hand-over: the proxy path returns its live client for the coordinator
    to adopt, and doing the same here would mean handing out a ``BLEDevice``
    pointing at this object path. That is worth doing, and it is not what this
    is. One extra dial costs a couple of seconds and needs no new machinery.

    Best effort throughout, and silent when there is no link: a bond that
    succeeded is not undone by a disconnect that does not.
