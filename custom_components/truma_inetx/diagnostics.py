# The BLE address is a resolvable private address that still pins the panel to
# a location, and muid/uuid are the persisted app identity the panel bonds
# against. The bus state itself carries nothing identifying.
# discovery_keys is here because redaction works on key names and that
# subtree hides the address inside a value: Home Assistant serialises the key
# as ``"repr": "DiscoveryKey(domain='bluetooth', key='76:32:EF:78:FD:1A',
# version=1)"``, which no address-named key matches. Every download written
# before this line carried the panel's address in it, the three attached to
# issue #22 included.
